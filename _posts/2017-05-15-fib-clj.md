title:  "Generating the Fibonacci Sequence in Clojure"
date:   2017-05-15 18:46:00 -0500

So today I was looking at the problem of generating the fibonacci sequence in **Clojure**. Figuring out the value of the sequence at a certain value `n` was simple enough, but the solution to return an entire sequence seemed to elude me. So I did some searching, and it seems like the primary solutions involved the use of lazy-sequences. So I've decided to write about these methods as they do provide insight into lazy sequences and recursion in clojure.

Simple
-------------
{% highlight clojure %}
{% endhighlight %}

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Create a document

The document panel is accessible using the <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> button in the navigation bar. You can create a new document by clicking <i class="icon-file"></i> **New document** in the document panel.

### Fenced code blocks

GitHub's fenced code blocks are also supported with **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting:

```
// Foo
var bar = 0;
```

> **Tip:** To use **Prettify** instead of **Highlight.js**, just configure the **Markdown Extra** extension in the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

> **Note:** You can find more information:

### Footnotes

You can create footnotes like this[^footnote].

  [^footnote]: Here is the *text* of the **footnote**.


### SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                  | ASCII                        | HTML              |
 ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------
| Single backticks | `'Isn't this fun?'`            | 'Isn't this fun?' |
| Quotes           | `"Isn't this fun?"`            | "Isn't this fun?" |
| Dashes           | `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash` | -- is en-dash, --- is em-dash |
