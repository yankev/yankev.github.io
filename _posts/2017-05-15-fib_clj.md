title:  "Generating the Fibonacci Sequence in Clojure"

So today I was looking at the problem of generating the fibonacci sequence in **Clojure**. Figuring out the value of the sequence at a certain value `n` was simple enough, but the solution to return an entire sequence seemed to elude me. So I did some searching, and it seems like the primary solutions involved the use of lazy-sequences. So I've decided to write about these methods as they do provide insight into lazy sequences and recursion in clojure.

-------------
{% highlight clojure %}
(defn simplefib [n]
 (case n
   0 0
   1 1
   (+ (simplefib (- n 1)) (simplefib (- n 2)))
 )
)

(simplefib 10)
; 55
{% endhighlight %}

So to get the `nth` we just have to use the definition of the fibonacci sequence in order to recursively build upwards, starting with the base cases. Now we move onto collecting these elements to return the full sequence up to the `nth` element.

#### The lazy sequence

The first method we're going to look at is possibly the closest and most recognizable to the simple recursive version we just looked at before.

{% highlight clojure %}

{% endhighlight %}


### Fenced code blocks

GitHub's fenced code blocks are also supported with **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting:

```
// Foo
var bar = 0;
```

> **Tip:** To use **Prettify** instead of **Highlight.js**, just configure the **Markdown Extra** extension in the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

> **Note:** You can find more information:

### Footnotes

You can create footnotes like this[^footnote].

### SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                  | ASCII                        | HTML              |
 ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------
| Single backticks | `'Isn't this fun?'`            | 'Isn't this fun?' |
| Quotes           | `"Isn't this fun?"`            | "Isn't this fun?" |
| Dashes           | `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash` | -- is en-dash, --- is em-dash |
