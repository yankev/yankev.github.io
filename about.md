Hi my name is Kevin, and my main focus of this blog will be on data science. I'm still in the midst of setting things up, so the first real post will not be up for a short while. Please bare with me. 
I'm a graduate of the University of Toronto with a masters degree in statistics. The majority of my degree was spent studying machine learning, and am now looking towards a career in data science.
