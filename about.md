Hi my name is Kevin, and my main focus of this blog will be on data science. I'm a graduate of the University of Toronto with a masters degree in statistics. The majority of my degree was spent studying machine learning, and I am now looking towards a career in data science. I just started this blog on January 11, 2015. Hopefully I'll be able to put up some interesting content.
